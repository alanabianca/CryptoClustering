# CryptoClustering
This project is used to demomstrate differnt methods of using unsupervised machine learning to create clusters and better visualize data. 

###Overview
The project was written in Python using several different libaries, uncluding sklearn, numpt, pandas,  hvplot, and holoviews. 
### Clusters:
The provided script first visualizes both the summary statistics table and the data on a plot. 
## K Values
K Values are found using scaled data (Standard Scaler). Then they are found a second time using the K-Means model.  Finally, PCA data is used to cluster the data. 
## Visualizations
The data is visualized in  the original cluster model, the later K-Means model, and the PCA model
